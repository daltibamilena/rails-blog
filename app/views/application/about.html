          In October 2016, I was able to have my first job as an IT, started as
          a system analist, here in this company I could learn a LOT about
          databases, one of my roles was to create reports using Microsoft SQL
          Server Reporting Services (SSRS). And then, I developed a simple blog
          where the workers could post about their jobs, with video and photos.

        <p>Stacks: SSRS, HMTL, CSS, SSRS, Windows, mySQL</p>

          April 2017, I could start as a back-end developer, here in this
          company I start to code using PHP with Laravel. They had a lot of cool
          projects that I was able to contribute, here a summary of them:
          Matr√≠cula Online: A system that made easier to enroll the student on
          state school, with this project the parents didn't need to get a
          massive queue on school to enroll their child, they were able to book
          a spot in school and then delivery the student documents on school to
          confirm that they want it. JOER: A system that could make the
          management of school games, they could set teams, coaches, manage a
          list of feeding and transportation of anyone that was participating.
          Codise: A system where they keep it up if the student was developing
          as they should, here they could know, by telling age, weight, and a
          few measurements if the child was underdeveloped or malnourished.

          April 2019, here in this company I take my first step as a Node.JS
          developer. My role was to developer web crawlers to get investments
          from financial companies and send it to our API. I was able to
          contribute in some Ruby on Rails project, the biggest one was a search
          engine to find investments by any filter available on our system. I
          did maintenance on Ruby on Rails projects and could learn and develop
          a crawler using AWS Lambdas.

      I really love to work as back-end, but I'm able to do something on
      front-end :)
